This is the solution for proposal to yandex summer practice in 2014

Target : (Novosibirsk, C++) Web browser development

Candidate : Zakharov Konstantin, Tomsk SU of CSR student

Task in short:

    Develop a small Ñ++ library "Thread pool" for company needs. It must provide
a functionality of managing thread count and queing tasks. Code must be written
according to Google C++ style guide
http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml

My comments:

    It was really interesting task, I've solved several issues which was really
unexpected for me. My code is an attempt to implement something like ZThread
Runnable-class functionality using standart C++ classes (instead of
platform-specific). This sources is awesome.

I've tried to use something from this code
http://habrahabr.ru/post/188234/
but the result is just ThreadPool::kGreedy dispath method (not so good) and
some of <mutex> usage. Ekkel volumes about multithreading is much better to study.

Reading Google C++ styleguide increased my skills in C++. The thoughts about
writing in one style was visiting my head during 7-8 months and now I've found
the answers.

As always, stackoverflow helped me a lot. For example - clock() function wasn't
working on linux, and showed x2-3 execution time because of 4 threads execution
(clock() uses proc ticks). But it became ok after rewriting timing with <chrono>.
Also there was a moment when I've started writing a question (after 2-3 hours of
debugging line "mutex_->lock()"), but found what's wrong by myself :)
