OVERVIEW:

    Concurrency is an increasingly important aspect of software today.
The BoboThreadd package is a simple standart C++ classes wrapper which provides
running your tasks in parralel. It provides a simple abstraction of the
standart C++ threading mechanisms to offer an easy way to increase calculation
speed or simplify your code.

    This software features ThreadPool object for C++. It gives the opportunity to
create runnable objects and run it in parallel using specified count of threads,
when standart C++ thread allow you to just run callback functions.

    This is a platform independent library due to using only std:: features. But
compilation strings differs a little.

    Library was tested under Windows 8 & Ubuntu 12.04LTS platforms. Since it uses
Google C++ style http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml
C++11 standart support required.
